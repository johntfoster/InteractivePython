To support my students, I'm using Binder to host some of my interactive Python spatial data analytics, geostatistics and machine learning demonstration workflows online. Some of my students are having issues with local environment configuration and instantiating the interactive workflows. I hope this will assist these students and remove barriers for these educational tools to invite a wider audience that may benefit from them. 

Sincerely,

Michael
